    <h2>Vivekananda</h2>
    Swami Vivekananda, known in his pre-monastic life as Narendra Nath Datta, was born in an affluent family in Kolkata
    on 12 January 1863. His father, Vishwanath Datta, was a successful attorney with interests in a wide range of
    subjects, and his mother, Bhuvaneshwari Devi, was endowed with deep devotion, strong character and other qualities.
    A precocious boy, Narendra excelled in music, gymnastics and studies. By the time he graduated from Calcutta
    University, he had acquired a vast knowledge of different subjects, especially Western philosophy and history. Born
    with a yogic temperament, he used to practise meditation even from his boyhood, and was associated with Brahmo
    Movement for some time.<br>

    With Sri Ramakrishna

    At the threshold of youth Narendra had to pass through a period of spiritual crisis when he was assailed by doubts
    about the existence of God. It was at that time he first heard about Sri Ramakrishna from one of his English
    professors at college. One day in November 1881, Narendra went to meet Sri Ramakrishna who was staying at the Kali
    Temple in Dakshineshwar. He straightaway asked the Master a question which he had put to several others but had
    received no satisfactory answer: “Sir, have you seen God?” Without a moment’s hesitation, Sri Ramakrishna replied:
    “Yes, I have. I see Him as clearly as I see you, only in a much intenser sense.”<br>

    Apart from removing doubts from the mind of Narendra, Sri Ramakrishna won him over through his pure, unselfish love.
    Thus began a guru-disciple relationship which is quite unique in the history of spiritual masters. Narendra now
    became a frequent visitor to Dakshineshwar and, under the guidance of the Master, made rapid strides on the
    spiritual path. At Dakshineshwar, Narendra also met several young men who were devoted to Sri Ramakrishna, and they
    all became close friends.<br>

    Difficult Situations<br>

    After a few years two events took place which caused Narendra considerable distress. One was the sudden death of his
    father in 1884. This left the family penniless, and Narendra had to bear the burden of supporting his mother,
    brothers and sisters. The second event was the illness of Sri Ramakrishna which was diagnosed to be cancer of the
    throat. In September 1885 Sri Ramakrishna was moved to a house at Shyampukur, and a few months later to a rented
    villa at Cossipore. In these two places the young disciples nursed the Master with devoted care. In spite of poverty
    at home and inability to find a job for himself, Narendra joined the group as its leader.<br>

    Beginnings of a Monastic Brotherhood<br>

    Sri Ramakrishna instilled in these young men the spirit of renunciation and brotherly love for one another. One day
    he distributed ochre robes among them and sent them out to beg food. In this way he himself laid the foundation for
    a new monastic order. He gave specific instructions to Narendra about the formation of the new monastic Order. In
    the small hours of 16 August 1886 Sri Ramakrishna gave up his mortal body.
    After the Master’s passing, fifteen of his young disciples (one more joined them later) began to live together in a
    dilapidated building at Baranagar in North Kolkata. Under the leadership of Narendra, they formed a new monastic
    brotherhood, and in 1887 they took the formal vows of sannyasa, thereby assuming new names. Narendra now became
    Swami Vivekananda (although this name was actually assumed much later.)<br>

    Awareness of Life’s Mission<br>

    After establishing the new monastic order, Vivekananda heard the inner call for a greater mission in his life. While
    most of the followers of Sri Ramakrishna thought of him in relation to their own personal lives, Vivekananda thought
    of the Master in relation to India and the rest of the world. As the prophet of the present age, what was Sri
    Ramakrishna’s message to the modern world and to India in particular? This question and the awareness of his own
    inherent powers urged Swamiji to go out alone into the wide world. So in the middle of 1890, after receiving the
    blessings of Sri Sarada Devi, the divine consort of Sri Ramakrishna, known to the world as Holy Mother, who was then
    staying in Kolkata, Swamiji left Baranagar Math and embarked on a long journey of exploration and discovery of
    India.<br>

    Discovery of Real India<br>

    During his travels all over India, Swami Vivekananda was deeply moved to see the appalling poverty and backwardness
    of the masses. He was the first religious leader in India to understand and openly declare that the real cause of
    India’s downfall was the neglect of the masses. The immediate need was to provide food and other bare necessities of
    life to the hungry millions. For this they should be taught improved methods of agriculture, village industries,
    etc. It was in this context that Vivekananda grasped the crux of the problem of poverty in India (which had escaped
    the attention of social reformers of his days): owing to centuries of oppression, the downtrodden masses had lost
    faith in their capacity to improve their lot. It was first of all necessary to infuse into their minds faith in
    themselves. For this they needed a life-giving, inspiring message. Swamiji found this message in the principle of
    the Atman, the doctrine of the potential divinity of the soul, taught in Vedanta, the ancient system of religious
    philosophy of India. He saw that, in spite of poverty, the masses clung to religion, but they had never been taught
    the life-giving, ennobling principles of Vedanta and how to apply them in practical life.<br>

    Thus the masses needed two kinds of knowledge: secular knowledge to improve their economic condition, and spiritual
    knowledge to infuse in them faith in themselves and strengthen their moral sense. The next question was, how to
    spread these two kinds of knowledge among the masses? Through education – this was the answer that Swamiji
    found.<br>

    Need for an Organization<br>

    One thing became clear to Swamiji: to carry out his plans for the spread of education and for the uplift of the poor
    masses, and also of women, an efficient organization of dedicated people was needed. As he said later on, he wanted
    “to set in motion a machinery which will bring noblest ideas to the doorstep of even the poorest and the meanest.”
    It was to serve as this ‘machinery’ that Swamiji founded the Ramakrishna Mission a few years later.<br>

    Decision to attend the Parliament of Religions<br>

    It was when these ideas were taking shape in his mind in the course of his wanderings that Swami Vivekananda heard
    about the World’s Parliament of Religions to be held in Chicago in 1893. His friends and admirers in India wanted
    him to attend the Parliament. He too felt that the Parliament would provide the right forum to present his Master’s
    message to the world, and so he decided to go to America. Another reason which prompted Swamiji to go to America was
    to seek financial help for his project of uplifting the masses.<br>
    Swamiji, however, wanted to have an inner certitude and divine call regarding his mission. Both of these he got
    while he sat in deep meditation on the rock-island at Kanyakumari. With the funds partly collected by his Chennai
    disciples and partly provided by the Raja of Khetri, Swami Vivekananda left for America from Mumbai on 31 May
    1893.<br>

    The Parliament of Religions and After<br>

    His speeches at the World’s Parliament of Religions held in September 1893 made him famous as an ‘orator by divine
    right’ and as a ‘Messenger of Indian wisdom to the Western world’. After the Parliament, Swamiji spent nearly three
    and a half years spreading Vedanta as lived and taught by Sri Ramakrishna, mostly in the eastern parts of USA and
    also in London.<br>

    Awakening His Countrymen<br>

    
    It is love and love alone that I preach, and I base my teaching on the great Vedantic truth of the sameness and
    omnipresence of the Soul of the Universe.<br>
